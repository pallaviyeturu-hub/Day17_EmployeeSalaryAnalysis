NAME:YETURU PALLAVI

REGISTRATION NUMBER:AP25110090132



The program first takes the student’s name, registration number, and section. 

Then it asks for the number of employees and stores all the salaries in a 1D array. 

A menu runs inside a while loop so the user can choose different operations. 



To calculate total and average salary, the program adds all salaries using a loop 

and divides by the number of employees. To find the highest and lowest salary, 

it compares each salary in the array. For above/below average count, it first 

calculates the average and then checks each salary. 



For sorting, a simple bubble sort is used to arrange salaries in ascending order. 

When the user selects Exit, the loop stops and the program finally prints the 

student’s identification details.
